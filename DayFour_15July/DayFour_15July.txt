Q1. What is the purpose of the Reflect object in JavaScript?

Reflect is like a toolbox in JavaScript that lets you perform common object operations (like getting, setting, or deleting properties) using simple function calls. 
It makes code cleaner, safer, and easier to control when working with meta-programming.

Example:
let person = { name: "John" };
Reflect.set(person, "name", "Alice"); // Sets name to Alice


Q2. When would you use a Symbol instead of a regular string as an object key?

Use a Symbol when you want to create a unique and hidden key that wonâ€™t accidentally overwrite or conflict with other keys.
It's helpful for storing private or internal data in objects.

Example:
const secretId = Symbol("id");
user[secretId] = "123abc"; // Not visible in loops or Object.keys()


Q3. What is the difference between "window.location" and "document.location"?

Both point to the current URL, but:
- window.location is the correct and standard way to get or change the page URL.
- document.location also works (for historical reasons), but it's not standard. You should use window.location.

Example:
window.location.href = "https://example.com"; // Redirects page


Q4. How can you detect if the user is online using JavaScript?

You can check if the browser is online using:
navigator.onLine

It returns true if the user is online, false if offline.

Example:
if (navigator.onLine) {
    console.log("You are online");
} else {
    console.log("You are offline");
}


Q5. Explain how the screen object differs from the window object.

- screen gives information about the user's physical screen, like width and height.
- window represents the browser window and contains everything (like document, history, etc.).

Example:
screen.width       // Width of the screen
window.innerWidth  // Width of the browser window (viewport)
